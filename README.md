# Hello.
### I'm quake1337, and I can be frequently found working on Terraria-related projects.

### Projects

I'm the creator of [Frostspark](https://github.com/Frostspark), a new server engine project for Terraria that improves upon its' predecessor's faults.

I've also created [Phantasm](https://github.com/bartico6/Phantasm), which is an anti-cheat plugin for Terraria, allowing to actively combat cheating in the game, by introducing rubberbanding for improbable player behaviours.

All of these projects are being developed primarily for use at [terraria.gg](https://terraria.gg) which is a Terraria server I'm planning on launching at some point in the future. There is no ETA because while I'd like to ship it ASAP, I don't want to compromise on quality. The server scene is very small and competitive in its nature, and you realistically only have one shot at making a good first impression.

I also semi-frequently contribute knowledge, consulting, expertise and code to friends at [tShock](https://github.com/Pryaxis/tShock). Go check it out, seriously.  

### About me

#### Skills

I'm a C# developer primarily. I know the language and the underlying runtime on a deep level, down to modifying programs using only IL modifications.

I also know and can use other languages on a decent level, some of them including Java, JS, CSS, HTML, Lua and C++.

I can (and do) both backend and fullstack development, however I'm still lacking in the single-page web-application department.

#### Commissions

I accept commissions for all kinds of projects as long as the pay is worth my time.  
**I don't work for free**.  
**I only accept payment in profit shares if you are already making profit, or can prove to me that your project will work.**

#### Education

I currently have the title of Bachelor of Computer Science, and I'm also pursuing a Master's degree, also in Computer Science.

#### Contact

Email: **quake at quake.tf**  
*I also own several private/professional email addresses which you might be receiving my resume from. If that's the case, please request proof of ownership of this GitHub profile, thanks!*
